# Grading System Frontend

## Setting up the frontend

### `npm install`

To install all the dependencies. A few dependencies may or may not get installed automatically, in which case the frontend will crash upon launch. If this happens, see the console logs and install them manually for now (this will be fixed in the final version).

### `npm run start-lin`
